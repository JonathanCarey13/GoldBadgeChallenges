# GoldBadgeChallenges

The purpose of these 3 assemblies is to create 3 different projects that utilize the knowledge we have learned at Eleven Fifty Academy until this point. Each assembly contains a program that utilizes a repository and a test unit. The 3 projects each show different programs that create, read, update and delete different types of collections.
